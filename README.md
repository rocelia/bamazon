# bamazon

The goal of this assignment was to create an Amazon store front using Node.js and MySql.

The Bamazon portal allows the user to see what is available for purchase. The user is prompted to select an item they would like to purchase and the amount. If there is enough in inventory, the purchase is confirmed and the total price is displayed. If the inventory is low and we are unable to fulfil the order, the user is notified that there is an insufficient quantity and the purchase does not go through.
